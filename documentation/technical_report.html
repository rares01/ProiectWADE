            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In the rapidly evolving realm of web development, the abundance and dynamism of technical content
                present both an opportunity and a challenge. Web developers, ranging from novices to experts, constantly
                seek up-to-date and relevant resources like tutorials, code examples, news, and event information.
                However, the vastness of available information, scattered across multiple platforms such as DevDocs,
                GitHub Pages, MDN Web Docs, Reddit, and others, often leads to information overload. Recognizing this
                challenge, our project aims to develop a multi-device, service-oriented system that intelligently
                models and manages this plethora of public technical content.
                <br>
                Leveraging the principles of Linked Data, our system not only aggregates content from various sources
                but also semantically enriches it, thereby enhancing its discoverability and usability. The core of our
                approach lies in creating a network of interconnected data, which is more meaningful and context-aware
                compared to the traditional isolated data silos. By utilizing a SPARQL endpoint, we enable both human
                users and software agents to query and retrieve web development knowledge tailored to specific criteria
                such as programming languages, frameworks, target platforms, purposes, geographical areas, and time
                periods. This personalized approach ensures that users receive content that is most relevant to their
                individual needs and preferences.
                <br>
                To further enrich the knowledge base, our system integrates additional insights from authoritative
                sources like DBpedia and Wikidata. This integration not only broadens the spectrum of available
                information but also adds layers of credibility and depth to the content.
                In essence, our project represents a step towards a smarter, more connected, and user-centric approach
                to managing web development knowledge. It promises to be a valuable tool for the global community of web
                developers, enabling them to stay abreast of the latest trends, technologies, and best practices in the
                field.

                <p>
                    The front-end of our app will handle the presentation and interactivity. It will allow users to
                    authenticate, set their preferences and browse content scraped from various sources. The front-end
                    will load data from the back-end via HTTP calls to our REST API that is exposed via a gateway.

                                <p>
                                    This is where the most of our business logic will reside. The web app is responsible
                                    for serving the dynamic content the users are requesting, along with various
                                    features such as filtering and ordering.

                                <p>
                                    This service will handle the authentication and authorization of our users, and will
                                    be used to check for and assign the correct permissions to users. We have currently
                                    planned for 3 tiers of users, namely anonymous (unauthenticated), authenticated and
                                    moderators/administrators, but the system is designed is such a way as to allow for
                                    easily adding new roles.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    This service will handle user-specific content recommendations. By taking into
                                    account user preferences, this service can suggest and compose a certain <i>feed</i>
                                    tailored for each user. We are considering using a machine learning approach for
                                    this.

                                    This service will handle scraping data from various sources. We are designing this
                                    service in an extensible way, in order to allow adding various different crawlers
                                    that can scrape data using custom methods. For example, we can have more
                                    specialized, RDFa or HTML micro-data crawlers, but also a generic HTML crawler as a
                                    fallback, and manually/automatically assign a crawler type to each source.

                    <p>
                        Our app will store two different types of data - user data (such as authentication information
                        and preferences) and resource/content data (such as data scraped from websites). For this, we
                        will use two different storages. The content storage will also be queryable via a
                        publicly-accessible SPARQL endpoint.

            <h2>Deployment</h2>
            <p>
                We will be using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud to deploy and host our application. Deploying
                directly on the cloud has many advantages, but we are mostly interested in the reduced operational load
                that this approach provides as opposed to a more DYI model (such as self-hosting). By not having to
                focus on managing local/self-hosted infrastructure and relying on AWS managed services, we can instead
                focus on developing the core functionalities of our app. We chose AWS over other cloud providers because
                we both have some experience using it, and because of the very generous <a href="#aws-free-tier">free
                    tier</a> it offers.
            </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Web Application</h3>

                <p>
                    For the deployment of the main web application (i.e. the "front-end" and the "Web App" from the
                    architecture diagram), we will use the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">AWS
                        Elastic Beanstalk</a> service. This is a service that manages the deployment of both front-end
                    and back-end code, and automatically handles provisioning capacity, load balancing, scaling and
                    health monitoring, so that we can focus more on development. Elastic Beanstalk uses other AWS
                    services such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a> (virtual machines) and <a
                        href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> (storage) to handle hosting and storing static content.

                <h3>API Gateways</h3>

                <p>
                    To manage access to our APIs, we decided to use the <a
                        href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway</a> service, which allows for easily
                    publishing and securing RESTful APIs. The service also handles other important web API
                    functionalities, such as CORS, throttling, authorization and authentication and monitoring. By using
                    this service, we can easily control and rate-limit which users have access to our public APIs
                    (including the SPARQL endpoint).

                <h3>(Micro)Services</h3>

                <p>
                    For the Authentication and Recommendations services, we will use <a
                        href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>. This is a serverless compute service, and
                    we chose this because serverless code it is easily scalable and extremely cheap. This way, we can
                    ensure that the application can deal with variable user count/traffic with minimal operational
                    effort required from us.

                <h3>Web Scraping</h3>

                <p>
                    In order to handle scraping large amounts of data from various sources, we decided to use <a
                        href="https://aws.amazon.com/batch/">AWS Batch</a>. As opposed to Lambda functions, AWS Batch
                    jobs don't have a 15-minute time limit, which makes them the perfect candidate for long-running
                    tasks such as web scraping. Also, they can easily be configured to be triggered at specific
                    intervals (such as once per day), similar to a cron job, via <a
                        href="https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/">AWS EventBridge</a>. This will make it easier to keep
                    the content fresh, while also allowing the possibility of running on-demand.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Storage</h3>

                <p>
                    Our app will store two different types of data - user data (such as authentication information and
                    preferences) and resource/content data (such as data scraped from websites). For this, we will use
                    two different types of storage.
                </p>

                            <p>
                                For storing user data, we will use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon
                                    DynamoDB</a>. We chose it because it is a a fully managed, serverless NoSQL database
                                that has various helpful features such as automatic backups and caching, and is very
                                cheap, with 25 GB of storage included in the free tier.

                            <p>
                                Since the scraped content will have to be queryable via SPARQL, it only makes sense for
                                us to store it into a easy-to-query graph database. This is why we chose <a
                                    href="https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/">Amazon Neptune</a>, a managed
                                high-performance graph database that will allow us to store large amounts of scraped
                                data, along with the relationships between the <i>things</i> we scrape.

                preferences. These can range from programming languages to frameworks and platforms, and will be heavily
                overlapped with the content data. External resources will be composed of data scraped from various
                websites about web development. We will split this data into different categories, such as tutorials,
                news, code examples etc. and store various metadata about them, including relationships with other

                and context-aware learning environment. The incorporation of user-customizable features, including
                personalized content filters based on various criteria, ensures that our system remains relevant and
                valuable to a broad spectrum of users, from beginners to seasoned professionals.
                <br>
                Looking ahead, the planned enhancements such as user comments, likes, and a robust moderation system
                will transform our platform into a dynamic and interactive community hub. This evolution will foster a
                more engaged and collaborative space, where knowledge sharing and peer-to-peer learning are not just
                facilitated but actively encouraged.
                <br>
                In essence, our project is more than just a content management system; it is a testament to the
                ever-evolving landscape of web development and the relentless pursuit of innovation that defines this
                field. We believe that our system will make a significant contribution to the way web developers access,
                share, and grow their knowledge, ultimately enriching the entire web development community.
